Process method

Hand_in_Hand decided to use agile process methods. We considered that the advantages of agile process methods would overcome the difficulties and disadvantages that comes from by choosing this process. Our website’s success is purely influenced by our clients. Moreover, it is not a over complicated project that needs to have very precise and accurate planning before the initialization of the project. We focused the fact that it would be very crucial to listen to our potential clients, such as what features would make our website more approachable and appealing.
The agile process methods go through the repetition of Plan->Design->Develop->Test->Feedback. We are planning to divide our work in a very realistic and short time parts so that it is easier to fix or modify clients’ needs. Focusing on communication with the clients would be one of the most priorities. The advantage of agile process is that we can decrease the time of launching, which enables us to flexible change and modification of the plan. This would be very helpful to the communication part that we mainly want to focus.
The disadvantages of deciding this method would be that there would be multiple cases of repetitive work as there would be constant requirements to change. Moreover, while applying big changes from the clients, the entire model might crash. Therefore, there would be lots of demand for group meetings and discussion which would require lots of time. The speed of the process might be fast but it would be difficult to react to bad features.
Despite these disadvantages, we still decided to go with agile process methods. As mentioned before, the communication with the clients is the most essential part to our project’s success. By using agile process methods, we expect that the project would be more approachable and very appealing to the clients. Rapid feedbacks and testing would help to satisfy our clients.
